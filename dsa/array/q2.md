Given an array of integers target, return an array result consisting of all elements
target [i] that are greater than both of their neighbors, i.e. that are target [i] >
max (target [i - 1], target [i+1]). Note, that target [0] and target [target.length - 1], which are the first and the last elements, are included by default, because they do not have two neighbors.
Note: You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time
complexity not worse than o(target.length3) will fit within the execution time limit.
Example
• For target = [1, 3, 1, 3, 2], the output should be solution (target)= [1, 3, 3,
21.
Explanation:
о
о
target [0] is included in the result by default, because it doesn't have two neighbors. result = [1] .
target [1] max (target [0], target [2]), so it is included in the result
result = [1, 3].
о target [2] >
max (target [1], target [3])
so it is not included in the result
result = [1, 3].
>
о
target [3] max (target [2], target [4])
so it is included in the result.
о
result = [1, 3, 3].
target [4] is included in the result by default, because it doesn't have two neighbors. result = [1, 3, 3, 21.
• For target = [1, 3, 3, 3], the output should be solution (target) = [1, 3]
