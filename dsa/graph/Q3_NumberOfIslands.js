Q. Number of islands
Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M consisting of 0 and 1. 
A group of connected 1's forms an island. 
From a cell (i, j) such that A[i][j] = 1 you can visit any cell that shares a corner with (i, j) and value in that cell is 1.
More formally, from any cell (i, j) if A[i][j] = 1 you can visit:

Return the number of islands.
- NOTE: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
Example Input

Input 1:
 A = [ 
       [0, 1, 0]
       [0, 0, 1]
       [1, 0, 0]
     ]
Input 2:
 A = [   
       [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
       [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
       [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]    
     ]
Example Output
Output 1:
 2
Output 2:
 5
